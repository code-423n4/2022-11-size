Does anytime have an issue compiling the code? it compiles, it just take a really long to compile. Looks like a foundry issue rather than a code isue.

yes it takes about the same for me, indeed because of via-ir


[11/05/2022 11:56] exd0tpy
Is there a walkaround?


[11/05/2022 12:37] jayphbee
If u set `via-ir=false` in foundry.toml. There will be stack too deep compile error

[11/05/2022 15:57] evmcheb
this is due to an issue in forge-std 1.0.0

yep, thats one of the recent solutions to stack too deep errors

v1.0.0 causes compiling with `via-ir` to take substantially longer ...
Recently, I added a via-ir testing to Solady for more robust testing, since it is a library. However, with the latest version of forge-std, the CI is still unable to finish compiling the code after...

you might be able to get around it by downgrading forge-std

Why a judge? Just DM the sponsors.

[11/06/2022 08:17] evmcheb
to revert to v0.3 you can use
`forge install foundry-rs/forge-std@c19dfd2f2a88a461216b0dd1f4961e1a85dcad46`
which should fix compile times

{Reactions}
🧠 

[11/06/2022 08:19] evmcheb
I don't believe there are any major changes between 0.3 and v1 but fwiw this is not a change to the project directory just a hotfix if compile times are annoying


[11/06/2022 13:31] lukejohn_
any documentation for the math part, espeically encrypt/decrypt messages using Point/pubkey/privkey?

How were clearingBase and clearingQuote determined in function finalize?


[11/06/2022 19:28] chaduke3730
Offline?


[11/06/2022 19:28] rag.e
yes


[11/06/2022 19:28] rag.e
the caller will decrypt the bids and determine the lowest clearing price of the auction


[11/06/2022 19:30] chaduke3730
Then one needs to verify these numbers are cottect online just like we need to verify the sorting  is cottect


[11/06/2022 19:30] rag.e
the verification of the sorting + clearing price is all done in finalize

What does "the emission schedule for the sold tokens" mean?


[11/06/2022 19:43] rag.e
Sellers can choose vesting parameters that will determine the schedule for token unlocks after the auction is finished


[11/06/2022 19:45] koolexc
is that happening regardless if the tokens were sold ?


[11/06/2022 19:45] koolexc
Just trying to understand  the unlocking here


[11/06/2022 19:45] rag.e
Unsold tokens get returned to the seller, the sold tokens are vested by the buyers


[11/06/2022 19:46] koolexc
Thank you! I'm wondering in what cases this is beneficial to the sellers or even buyers?


[11/06/2022 19:49] rag.e
A seller could be motivated to add vesting to slow down the sell pressure of the tokens, if the seller is a large holder for example

Buyers would obviously like no vesting, so the likely scenario is that vested auctions command a discount to the market price

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[11/06/2022 19:50] koolexc
Thanks! that makes sense


[11/06/2022 19:51] rag.e
Great, thanks for the questions

[11/06/2022 20:02] raymondfam
Is quoteAmount the number of quoteToken for each baseToken?


[11/06/2022 20:15] koolexc
what is supposed to happen if the seller doesn't reveal the private key in 24 hours after a finished auction?


[11/06/2022 23:23] rag.e
quoteAmount is the amount of quoteToken for the entire baseAmount (after decryption)
for example

1000 usdc (quoteAmount) for 1 eth (baseAmount)

{Reactions}
👀 

[11/06/2022 23:24] rag.e
The auction is voided, and all bids can be cancelled and refunded. The seller is refunded as well


[11/06/2022 23:35] raymondfam
So this ratio serves as the price a bidder is willing to pay for?


[11/06/2022 23:35] rag.e
yes!


[11/06/2022 23:35] rag.e
and that price is hidden until the seller's key is revealed


[11/06/2022 23:38] raymondfam
Great. The conditional check on lines 103 - 105 serves both as a token code existence check and also filtering off fee on transfer token?


[11/06/2022 23:38] rag.e
yes it accomplishes both


[11/06/2022 23:39] raymondfam
Thanks


[11/07/2022 07:20] c7e7eff
So it's the intent the seller can just not do the reveal?


[11/07/2022 07:26] trust90
Yeah, there is a safeguard in place, buyers can canceBid


[11/07/2022 11:53] koolexc
compiling is still taking long .. although I installed 
`forge install foundry-rs/forge-std@c19dfd2f2a88a461216b0dd1f4961e1a85dcad46 `
any ideas how to go around this issue?

{Reactions}
🧐 

[11/07/2022 15:09] evmcheb
can you try `forge install foundry-rs/forge-std@2a2ce3692b8c1523b29de3ec9d961ee9fbbc43a6`?


[11/07/2022 15:09] evmcheb
both `c19d` and `2a2c` take about 40 seconds on my machine

[11/07/2022 15:59] redonen_
Hello, could anyone explain why does the multiplication by "type(uint128).max" is applied on line 78 ?


[11/07/2022 16:05] evmcheb
We multiply by `type(uint128).max` to ensure there are no rounding errors in the division, since there might be many less decimals in the quoteToken than the baseToken


[11/07/2022 16:35] redonen_
Thanks for the reply ! Same for the ReserveQuotePerBase when declared I guess  ?


[11/07/2022 17:52] bizzyvinci
Is there a documentation about size protocol and seal?


[11/07/2022 18:34] trustminimised
I found a whitepaper on google, but that's all that turned up for me.


[11/07/2022 21:55] rag.e
We don't have a whitepaper, the documentation right now is the readme and the code/natspec


[11/07/2022 22:29] raymondfam
type(uint128).max is a very big number. If you multiply it with auctionParams.minimumBidQuote, isn't it going to easily exceed the total reserve?


[11/07/2022 22:31] 100proof
You can multiply two 128-bit numbers together within 256 bits without overflow.

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/07/2022 22:31] rag.e
reserve is a uint256
you can verify for yourself that any uint128 * uint128 will never overflow that


[11/07/2022 22:32] 100proof
The proof relies on the mathematical fact that
`2**n * 2**m == 2**(m + n)`

{Reactions}
🧠 

[11/07/2022 22:32] 100proof
If `m` and `n` are both `128` you're fine.


[11/07/2022 23:08] raymondfam

If you need help, can you open a help desk request please: https://code4rena.com/help


[11/08/2022 16:07] trustminimised
@Rage I can't quite understand this comment due to the grammar.
In `cancelBid()` `// Only allow bid cancellations while not finalized or in the reveal period`
Does this mean that cancellations are only intentionally allowed while the auction state is "AcceptingBids"? Or "AcceptingBids" _and_ "RevealPeriod"?


[11/08/2022 16:12] rag.e
yea that comment is a bit bad
its saying

not allowed in either Finalized or RevealPeriod
